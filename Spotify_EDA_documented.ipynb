    "# **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of My Spotify Listening History**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***By Youssef ZEROUAL***\n",
    "## **1 Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The present analysis draws upon my own spotify listening data downloaded from Spotify's \"Extended Streaming History\" request, consisting of JSON files covering the period from 2018 to 2025. Additionay, the main streaming data was combined with my 'liked' playlist data that I downloaded using Exportify, in order to enrich the main dataset with track features such as duration, energy, da,ceability, addition date, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this EDA is to **uncover patterns, anomalies, and potential insights** within my extended listening history. The approach involves understanding the data structure and identifying trends, then generating further questions for deeper analysis based on observed patterns. The process includes data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, performing basic statistics, data aggregation, and visualization.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Curation Spikes**  \n",
    "  - Are there specific periods (e.g., certain months or years) that show intense curation spikes or declines?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **D. Analyzing Genre and Artist Preferences**\n",
    "This section dives into genre and artist preferences based on listening behavior:\n",
    "- **Genre Preferences**  \n",

    "### **1.2 Dataset Overview** \n",
    "- **Source**: Downloaded from [Spotify's \"Extended Streaming History\" data request](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/). and Exportify website.\n",
    "- **Format**: The main streeming dataset is in JSON format (`endsong_*.json`) while the liked playlist is a csv file.\n",
    "- **Period**: 2018-2025\n",
    "- **Expected Variables**:  \n",
    "  - Timestamps, track/artist names, play duration, skipped tracks, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3. Approach** \n",
    "The workflow for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Spotify listening history begins by **loading and combining multiple JSON files containing streaming data from 2018 to 2025 into a single dataset**. Initial data inspection involves checking dimensions and identifying missing values, followed by **cleaning steps such as removing irrelevant podcast/audiobook columns** **and dropping rows with missing timestamps or track names**. The dataset is then **merged with liked songs data**, and **features are engineered to extract time-based information, calculate play metrics, and add sequential temporal identifiers**. Further data quality checks include filtering out extremely short playbacks and addressing anomalies like overlapping entries, before proceeding with various analyses on listening patterns by time, artists, genres, and song engagement."

    "\n",
    "This part of our notebook performs feature engineering on the `df_merged` DataFrame to add sequential month, day, and hour columns. These new columns facilitate easier analysis of the dataset over time.\n",

    "##### **Key Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Month Dictionary**:\n",
    "   - `month_dict_inverted`: A dictionary mapping month names to their corresponding numerical values (1-12).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding Sequential Month**:\n",
    "   - Convert the `month` column to numerical values using the `month_dict_inverted` dictionary.\n",
    "   - Fill any missing values with 0 and convert the column to integer type.\n",
    "   - Create a `year_month` column by converting the `ts` column to a period of months.\n",
    "   - Group by `year` and `month_n` to create a DataFrame (`df_months`) with a sequential month number (`month_sequential_n`).\n",
    "   - Merge `df_months` back into `df_merged` to add the `month_sequential_n` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adding Sequential Day**:\n",
    "   - Create a `year_day` column by converting the `ts` column to a period of days.\n",
    "   - Extract the day from the `ts` column and create a `day` column.\n",
    "   - Group by `ts` and `day` to create a DataFrame (`df_days`) with a sequential day number (`day_sequential_n`).\n",
    "   - Merge `df_days` back into `df_merged` to add the `day_sequential_n` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adding Sequential Hour**:\n",
    "   - Group by `ts` and `hour` to create a DataFrame (`df_hours`) with a sequential hour number (`hour_sequential_n`).\n",
    "   - Merge `df_hours` back into `df_merged` to add the `hour_sequential_n` column.\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Month**:\n",
    "  - Facilitates time-series analysis by providing a continuous sequence of months.\n",
    "  - Useful for visualizing trends over months.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Day**:\n",
    "  - Provides a continuous sequence of days, useful for daily trend analysis.\n",
    "  - Helps in identifying patterns and anomalies on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequential Hour**:\n",
    "  - Provides a continuous sequence of hours, useful for hourly trend analysis.\n",
    "  - Helps in identifying peak hours and patterns within a day.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### **🔝 Top Listening Years**\n",
    "- **2020** was my **most active year** for listening, with a total of **368.7 hours** (~15.4 days). This could be attributed to more time spent at home during global events, leading to increased music streaming.\n",
    "- **2022 (331.3 hours)** and **2024 (307.9 hours)** follow closely, indicating consistently high engagement in recent years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 📉 **Decline in Listening Activity**\n",
    "- After 2020, there’s a general decline in total listening time, with **2021** being the lowest point in the early 2020s at **183.9 hours**.\n",
    "- The most significant drop appears between **2024 and 2025**, where listening time almost halves to **91.5 hours** — potentially signaling a change in lifestyle, preferences, or data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 📅 **Early Years**\n",
    "- **2018** has only **0.6 hours** of playback — likely due to incomplete data or minimal usage at the start of the tracking period.\n",
    "- By **2019**, listening time jumped significantly to **205.3 hours**, showing early growth in music consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 🧠 **Observations & Possible Explanations:**\n",
    "- **Peak in 2020:** Could align with increased居家时间 (time at home) during that year, prompting more music streaming.\n",
    "- **High 2024 Listening:** Might suggest renewed interest in music, new listening habits, or possibly offline activity syncing later.\n",
    "- **Sharp Drop in 2025:** Could be due to reduced music usage, busier lifestyle, or possibly incomplete data capture for that year.\n",

    "- **Post-April Surge**: After a very low point in April, usage begins rising sharply starting in May and peaks in July — potentially aligning with emotional or situational shifts during the pandemic.\n",

    "  - Multiple entries between **10 PM – 2 AM**, possibly linked to relaxation, work, or insomnia-driven listening.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 📅 **Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📆 **Session-Based Usage**:\n",
    "  - I tend to listen for **longer durations during specific blocks**, rather than short bursts throughout the day.\n",
    "  - This supports earlier insights where certain **days** or **months** dominate total playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📈 **Spotify as Ambient Companion**:\n",
    "  - Many hours show near-full playback (0.8–1.0 hrs), suggesting Spotify is used as background music while working, relaxing, or commuting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧩 **Noisy Data?**:\n",
    "  - Some entries show exactly **1.0 hour**, which could indicate either:\n",
    "    - A full-hour playlist looping\n",
    "    - Rounded data\n",
    "    - Or streaming while performing another activity\n",

    "  - Explore if these high-listening hours align with **work, study, travel**, or **emotional states**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🎵 **Playlist Optimization**:\n",
    "  - Long listening blocks suggest opportunities for curated **focus playlists**, **ambient mixes**, or **multi-hour sessions** tailored to specific moods or tasks.\n"

    "## **7. Conclusion**\n",
    "Drawing upon the analyses performed on my Spotify listening history data from 2018-2025, we can synthesize the key insights, connect findings across different analyses, draw general conclusions about my listening habits, and propose further questions and hypotheses for deeper exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7.1 Summary of Key Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) covered various aspects of my Spotify usage, including listening time trends, artist and genre preferences, and song curation habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Overall Listening Trends:** I have a substantial listening history with 68,731 initial listening records, spanning 2018-2025. After cleaning, focusing on plays >= 30 seconds and resolving playback anomalies, the dataset contains 33,255 entries.\n",
    "*   **Annual Listening:** **2020 was my most active listening year**, with 368.7 hours played, potentially linked to global events leading to more time at home. Listening dropped sharply in 2025, which could indicate reduced music usage, a busier lifestyle, or possibly incomplete data.\n",
    "*   **Monthly Listening:** Aggregating across all years, **August is consistently a top listening month**, followed by October and September. There's a noticeable drop in activity during April and May. Looking specifically at 2020, July was the peak month with 66.8 hours, and late summer to fall (August–November) was the most active period.\n",
    "*   **Weekly Listening:** The analysis reveals the total hours played on each day of the week, showing variations.\n",
    "*   **Hourly Listening:** **12 PM (noon) is my most frequent listening hour**, potentially for lunch breaks or midday sessions. High engagement windows are from 11 AM–1 PM and 5 PM–10 PM, aligning with late morning, early afternoon, and evening use. Listening drops significantly after midnight, with the fewest plays from 4 AM–5 AM. A morning surge starts from 7 AM, peaking around 10 AM.\n",
    "*   **Top Genres:** my taste is **diverse, spanning classical, rock, folk, pop, and regional styles**. **\"Post-rock, dream pop\" is the top genre by listening time** (37.67 hours), followed surprisingly by Polka (29.8 hours). Multiple classical subgenres also rank highly.\n",
    "*   **Top Artists by Playback Hours:** Classical artists **Beethoven, Sigur Rós, and Mozart** lead by total hours played, often associated with longer song durations. Sigur Rós ranks #2 overall (45.13 hours), reinforcing their appeal for extended listening.\n",
    "*   **Top Artists by Play Count:** Focusing on frequency rather than duration, **Classical composers Ludwig van Beethoven and Johann Sebastian Bach rank highest by play count**, followed by Sufjan Stevens and Atahualpa Yupanqui. Sigur Rós is still in the top 10 by count. This view shows a broader mix of classical, folk, and international artists.\n",
    "*   **Song Adding Habits:** You've added a total of 3065 unique songs to my library between 2019 and 2025. **2022 was the peak year for adding new songs** (795 tracks), accounting for over 26% of all liked songs. There's a steady drop in new additions from mid-2023 onward, with minimal activity in 2025.\n",
    "*   **Yearly Added Tracks:** Analyzing month-by-month additions for each year, **February, September, and October often show spikes** in new song curation across multiple years. September 2020 had the highest monthly additions (140 tracks).\n",
    "*   **Added Songs by Genre (2022):** In my most active year for adding, **Polka was the most added genre** (26 tracks), followed by chamber pop/baroque pop, gangster rap/west coast hip hop, and slowcore/singer-songwriter (13 each). The year shows a high genre diversity (282 unique genres) in new additions.\n",
    "*   **New Song Additions by Month (Overall):** Across all years, monthly additions show high variability (std dev ~37). Early 2020, 2022, and 2023 saw intense curation spikes, while a decline is noted after 2022.\n",
    "*   **Daily Song Engagement:** **\"A Meaningful Moment Through a Meaning(less) Process\"** and **\"Casimir Pulaski Day\"** were played on the most unique days (67 and 62 days respectively), indicating frequent revisits. These are often accompanied by high total listening minutes, suggesting they are \"frequently played favorites\".\n",
    "*   **Hourly Song Engagement:** **\"Attrape-rêve\"** and **\"Casimir Pulaski Day\"** appeared in the most unique hourly sessions (97 and 95 unique hours respectively). High hourly counts with high total minutes again point to frequently played favorites, potentially integrated into daily or hourly routines.\n",
    "*   **Peak Hour Analysis for Top Songs:** Top engagement days for \"Attrape-rêve\" show plays spread across several hours (e.g., 10 AM, 5-8 PM, 10 PM). \"Emmylou\" and \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" show plays concentrated in fewer, distinct hours per day (e.g., 10 AM, 6 PM, 10 PM, 11 PM). This suggests some songs are integrated into broader daily listening, while others are tied to more specific times or shorter sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7.2 Relating and Connecting the Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "Several patterns emerge when connecting findings across analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The 2020 Peak:** The peak in total listening hours in 2020 is consistent with the peak months for *listening* within that year (July, November, September). While 2020 wasn't the peak year for *adding* new songs (that was 2022), it still saw high curation activity in certain months (July, September), aligning with periods of high listening. The top daily listening days also reinforce the dominance of July and September 2020. This suggests 2020 was a period of both intense listening *and* active discovery/curation, possibly driven by external circumstances like lockdowns.\n",
    "2.  **The 2025 Decline:** The sharp drop in total listening hours in 2025 mirrors the minimal activity in song additions for the same year. This dual decline suggests a significant shift in overall Spotify engagement, impacting both listening volume and the habit of curating new music.\n",
    "3.  **Artist/Genre Dominance:** The top genres by hours (Post-rock/Dream Pop, Classical) are directly linked to the top artists by hours (Sigur Rós, Beethoven, Mozart). The deep dive into \"post-rock, dream pop\" confirms **Sigur Rós's overwhelming dominance within that genre**, accounting for almost all playback time. Comparing hours played vs. play count reveals that artists with longer average track lengths (like Classical composers and Sigur Rós) rank higher by hours, while artists with shorter, frequently revisited songs (like certain folk or traditional artists) rank higher by count. This highlights different modes of engagement – long, immersive sessions vs. shorter, repeated plays.\n",
    "4.  **Song Longevity and Engagement:** The analysis of songs played across multiple years identifies \"evergreen favorites\" with consistent play history. \"O surdato ’nnammurato - Live\" by Massimo Ranieri, played across 7 years, aligns with Massimo Ranieri's presence in the top artists by count, suggesting deep, long-term engagement with certain tracks. Tracks like \"A Meaningful Moment Through a Meaning(less) Process\" and \"Casimir Pulaski Day\" appearing on the most unique days and hours further emphasize that certain songs are not just listened to for extended periods (hours), but are also integrated into daily and hourly routines over time.\n",
    "5.  **Adding vs. Listening:** While 2022 was the peak year for *adding* songs, it was the *third* most active year for *listening*. This suggests that the period of peak music discovery and curation (2022) might not perfectly align with the period of peak overall listening volume (2020). The high number of genres added in 2022 compared to the top genres by listening hours (dominated by Post-rock/Dream Pop and Classical) indicates that my curation habits explore a wider range of genres than what I spend the most time listening to.\n",
    "6.  **Seasonal and Temporal Patterns:** Consistently high listening in late summer/fall months (August-November) across years and peak listening hours (11 AM-1 PM, 5 PM-10 PM) suggest predictable engagement windows. These patterns could be tied to lifestyle, work, or seasonal moods. The spikes in song additions in February, September, and October could align with seasonal mood shifts or periods of active playlist curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7.3 General Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these insights, several conclusions about my Spotify listening behavior can be drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Eclectic and Deep Taste:** I possess a diverse musical taste, engaging with genres from classical and post-rock to regional folk and niche styles. Within this diversity, there is also significant depth, with artists like Sigur Rós dominating specific genres and classical composers featuring heavily in both hours and play counts.\n",
    "*   **Event-Influenced Engagement:** Major life events or external circumstances (like global events in 2020) appear to significantly impact both listening volume and potentially curation habits.\n",
    "*   **Structured Listening Habits:** my listening shows clear patterns based on the time of day (midday, evening peaks), day of the week, and months/seasons (late summer/fall peaks).\n",
    "*   **Long-Term Loyalty to Favorites:** I return to certain songs and artists consistently over many years, indicating a deep emotional or habitual connection to them. These evergreen favorites cross genre boundaries.\n",
    "*   **Distinct Curation and Listening Behaviors:** The peak period for discovering and adding new music (2022) does not perfectly overlap with the peak period for overall listening (2020). Furthermore, my curation explores a wider array of genres than my consistent, high-volume listening.\n",
    "*   **Potential for Lifestyle Correlation:** Many patterns (2020 peak, midday/evening listening, seasonal trends, recent decline) strongly suggest that listening behavior is closely tied to my daily routines, work patterns, mood, and overall lifestyle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **7.4 Deeper Questions for Further Analysis and Hypotheses**\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis provides a strong foundation, but also raises intriguing questions for deeper exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Investigating the 2020 Peak:**\n",
    "    *   *Question:* What specific lifestyle changes or events in 2020 correlated with the significant increase in listening and curation?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* The peak in 2020 listening is directly attributable to increased time spent at home during lockdowns or remote work periods. This period also saw higher engagement with atmospheric/focus-oriented genres.\n",
    "2.  **Understanding the 2025 Decline:**\n",
    "    *   *Question:* Is the sharp drop in listening and additions in 2025 due to a change in music consumption habits (e.g., switching platforms, less free time) or an issue with data capture for that specific year?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* The decline in 2025 reflects a genuine shift in lifestyle leading to less time for music listening and discovery, rather than a data anomaly.\n",
    "3.  **Deconstructing Genre Preferences:**\n",
    "    *   *Question:* What are the specific characteristics (audio features like energy, valence, tempo) of the top genres and artists by listening hours compared to those highest by play count or curation?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* Genres/artists high in total hours played have specific audio features (e.g., lower energy, higher instrumentalness) that make them suitable for long, background listening sessions, while artists high in play count might have features suited for shorter, repeated plays.\n",
    "    *   *Question:* Why does Polka rank so highly in both listening hours and 2022 additions? Is there a specific context or emotional connection to this genre?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* The high ranking of Polka is linked to a specific personal memory, cultural tie, or period of focused interest, distinct from typical music consumption patterns.\n",
    "4.  **Connecting Curation and Listening:**\n",
    "    *   *Question:* How long, on average, after a song is added to the liked songs library is it first played or frequently listened to?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* There is a significant delay between adding a song and it becoming a \"frequently played favorite,\" indicating a curation process that is separate from immediate listening.\n",
    "    *   *Question:* Do the audio features or genres of songs added in peak curation periods (e.g., Feb/Sep/Oct, or 2022) differ from those added in other periods?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* Peak curation periods focus on discovering specific types of music (e.g., more diverse, specific moods) compared to periods of lower activity.\n",
    "5.  **Analyzing Temporal Patterns Further:**\n",
    "    *   *Question:* How do peak listening hours (11 AM-1 PM, 5 PM-10 PM) vary by weekday vs. weekend?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* Midday peaks are stronger on weekdays (lunch breaks/focus), while evening peaks are more pronounced or shift later on weekends (relaxation/social).\n",
    "    *   *Question:* Are the \"evergreen favorite\" songs played consistently across all times of the day/week/year, or are they tied to specific routines or seasons?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* Evergreen favorites are often played during specific, repeated routines (e.g., morning commute, evening winding down) rather than randomly throughout the year.\n",
    "6.  **Exploring Behavioral Context:**\n",
    "    *   *Question:* Can we correlate listening patterns (especially intense sessions or specific songs) with external factors like weather, mood logs (if available), or calendar events?\n",
    "    *   *Hypothesis:* Days with high listening hours or plays of emotionally charged songs are associated with specific moods (e.g., stress, relaxation, nostalgia) or activities (e.g., long work sessions, travel).\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring these questions and testing these hypotheses, we could gain a much deeper understanding of the underlying reasons and contexts driving my unique Spotify listening journey over the years."
